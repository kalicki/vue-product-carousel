[Online Demo](https://cdn.rawgit.com/probil/vue-product-carousel/vue-2.0/index.html)

## Usage

To be able to use this component you should install it first
```bash
npm i --save vue-product-carousel
```
Then import it:
```js
import carousel from 'vue-product-carousel'
```

Use `carousel` component and pass your images as `images` prop:

```js
<template>
  <carousel :images="images">
  </carousel>
</template>
<script>
...
data(){
  images:[
    'http://lorempixel.com/1000/1000/business/1/',
    'http://lorempixel.com/1000/1000/business/2/',
    'http://lorempixel.com/1000/1000/business/3/'
  ]
}
components:{
  carousel
}
...
</script>
...
```
Note: You will need [Babel Loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader) in your Webpack config file in order to support ES6 syntax inside component.

## Testing

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
